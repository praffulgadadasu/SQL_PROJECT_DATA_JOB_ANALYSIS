# üìà Job Market Data Analysis with SQL

Unlocking Insights From Job Market Data ‚Äî One Query at a Time

---

## Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end analysis of the job market using real-world datasets and **SQL**. Inspired by Luke Barousse's workflow, I recreated the project from scratch to sharpen my data analysis and SQL skills, with my own perspective and presentation.

Whether you are an aspiring analyst or a seasoned data enthusiast, this project demonstrates how to extract actionable insights from raw job market data using just SQL, and how to share your results effectively on GitHub.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Exploration**: Connect to job listings data and understand the structure.
- **SQL Analysis**: Perform queries to answer real job market questions (top job titles, trending skills, salary ranges, most active locations, and more).
- **Reproducibility**: Every SQL script and output is available for reference and learning.
- **Visualization (Optional)**: Quick visuals using SQL-friendly tools to summarize results (e.g., DB Browser, DataGrip).
- **Sharing**: Results are clearly organized for others to review and reuse.

## Key Questions Answered

- What are the most in-demand job titles?
- Which skills are most frequently requested by employers?
- How do salary ranges vary by job role or location?
- Which cities have the most job openings?
- What companies are hiring the most?
